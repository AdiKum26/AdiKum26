## 🌟 What I Build

I build **AI systems that ship** — production voice agents, ML pipelines, and full-stack apps focused on **real users**, not demos.

- 🧠 **Co-Founder, OuraNote** — AI mental health journaling platform (web + mobile) with sentiment analysis and a voice-based AI assistant; presented to **700+ students**, **100+ visits / 30 active users** at MVP  
- 🔧 **AI Engineer @ Finderly (5,000+ users)** — building a **real-time AI home-repair assistant** (Whisper + GPT-4o + TTS) inside a production React Native app  
- 🏆 **DubHacks 2025** — built **Seekr**, an AI research & career agent matching UW students to labs, professors, and opportunities using **AWS Bedrock + Lambda + DynamoDB**

I care about **shipping fast**, **system reliability**, and designing **emotionally intelligent AI**.
