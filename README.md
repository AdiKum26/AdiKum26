🚀 About Me

I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Washington – Seattle, originally from South Africa. I’m driven by a passion for solving real-world problems through thoughtful software and human-centered design. My work spans machine learning, full-stack development, and mental health tech — often combining technical skill with social impact.

Recently, I launched **OuraNote**, a mental health journaling app that lets users write letters to their future selves, track mood progression through AI-powered sentiment analysis, and reflect privately over time. I had the opportunity to present the app to 700+ students at my former high school in South Africa — a full-circle moment inspired by a Grade 8 classroom activity that first sparked the idea.

I believe in building with purpose and learning through collaboration — whether in engineering, leadership, or community work.
