# 🌟 What I Do

I build **AI systems that people actually use** — production-grade voice agents, mobile apps, and ML pipelines that solve *real human problems*, not just demo well.

- 🧠 **Co-Founder of OuraNote** – AI mental health platform (web + mobile) with voice therapist, emotional analytics, and AES-encrypted journals. Presented live to **700+ students**; 100+ users at MVP.
- 🔧 **AI Engineer @ Finderly (5,000+ users)** – building an autonomous **AI home-repair assistant** (real-time Whisper + GPT-4o + TTS) inside a production React Native app.
- 🥇 **DubHacks 2025** – Created **Seekr**, an AI research & career agent that instantly matches UW students to real labs, professors, jobs, and scholarships using **AWS Bedrock + Lambda + DynamoDB**.

I care about **shipping fast**, designing **emotionally intelligent AI**, and building products that make people’s lives better.
