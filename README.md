## 🚀 What I Build

I build AI products that **people actually use** — systems that go beyond prototypes and solve **real human problems**.

- 🧠 **Co-Founder of OuraNote** — AI-powered mental health journaling platform with voice therapist, live sentiment analysis & AES encryption. Presented live to **700+ students**.
- 🔧 **AI Intern @ Finderly (5,000+ users)** — building a **hands-free AI repair assistant** with real-time Whisper + GPT + TTS.
- 🎓 **DubHacks 2025** — built **Seekr**, an AI research & career agent that matches UW students to **real professors, labs, scholarships & jobs** and auto-drafts outreach emails using **AWS Bedrock + Lambda + DynamoDB + OpenAI failover**.

I care about **shipping fast**, **designing meaningful user experiences**, and **making AI feel human — not robotic**.
